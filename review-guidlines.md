# Review Guidelines

- Do a sanity check on the contributor of the logo.
  Are they even related to the organization in question? And especially for
  larger organizations: do they realistically have the permission to allow us the
  usage?
- Quickly check the logo:
  - Is it a valid SVG file?
  - Is it just a PNG file base64 encoded into the SVG?
  - Is it 100 MB of invisible paths?
  - Does it fulfill the [Logo Requirements](./logo-requirements.md)?
